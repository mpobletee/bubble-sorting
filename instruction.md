## üìù Instructions  

1.- Create a function that generates a list of random cards with suits.
#
2.- Let the user specify how much random cards the website should generate using a text input.
#
3.- Add a "draw" button that when clicked it renders those cards on the website in a beautiful way.
#
4.- Add one "sort" button that sorts the cards using the bubble sorting algorithm.
#
5.- Save all the changes that you hard to do while sorting the list of cards in a new array.
#
6.- Display the entire log of changes one on top of each other.

üí° Hint: 

1.- Strategize first, no one starts coding the solution before having a clear strategy.

2.- Stick to your strategy, forget about Stack Overflow for strategy.

3.- Divide and conquer, try separating the exercise in smaller exercises, for example:

3.1.- Make the hardcoded CSS and HTML before trying to make it dynamic, that will give you a clear sense of what HTML code you need to build with your algorithm.

3.2.- Generate an array of random cards first, make sure is properly being generated (using the console.log) before trying to render it into the website.

3.3.- Make a function just for building the HTML of ONE card and then re-use it to render all.
